# P2P

> This mod adds Peer-to-Peer capabilities to Minecraft

With this mod, it is possible to set up a scalable, independent P2P network.

## In-Depth

It relies on the external P2P library [TomP2P](http://tomp2p.net/) written in Java.

The goal is to provide an API for others mods so that they can use the P2P functionalities provided by the library without having to look directly at its code. The API also needs to minimize the impact of switching to another library for others mods.
